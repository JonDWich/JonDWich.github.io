            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Jon, a 4th year computer science student with a penchant for video game design and systems programming.</p>
            <p>
            I have four years of experience working on complex modifications to existing games, such as turning an action platformer into a Roguelike,
            overhauling a character controller to support physics, extending combat systems, and writing a framework for animation playback.
            <br>
            I also have experience with testing games during development, including the commercially released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/858710/Gravity_Circuit/" target="_blank" title="Gravity Circuit">Gravity Circuit.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Below you'll find short overviews of the skills used and difficulties faced in these projects, as well as links to more detailed writeups.
